This project is focused on implementing a computerized system for Nugasewana, a restaurant located in Kaluthara District 
that opened in 2020. The restaurant has gained popularity among local and foreign customers due to its commitment to 
continuous improvement and high-quality standards in hospitality. However, the management and staff are currently 
managing all their processes manually, such as employee management, supplier management, delivery management, and 
financial account management, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs

Here are some screesnshots about this project.....!
